Kid:#Well, what are you waiting for?
Fox:#...on the other hand, it is pretty dark. Your dad is right: who#knows what kind of things are out at night on Uranus?
Fox:#Here's your mittens, thanks for lending them to me! But I think#I'll go back to my ship and heat up some hot cocoa.
Kid:#Fine, I guess I'll finish the snowmen tomorrow. I'm gonna go#have some soup, see ya!
